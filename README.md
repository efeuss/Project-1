# Project 1
<h1> College Recruitment Improvement Study </h1> 

<b>Goal:</b> Using Python, perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.

<h2>Part 1: Data Study Questions</h2>
Formulate the data study questions that you will answer in your analysis.  You will also be assigned a few questions to answer by your instructor. 

<h2>Part 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning</h2>
The datasets provided are messy.  You will explore the datasets, first in Excel. Then you use Python to bring in your datasets into a your coding environment, and explore the datasets further to identify what cleaning actions you will perform on the data.

<h2>Part 3: Data Analysis and Visualization</h2>
Using your cleaned dataset, you will then perform analysis to answer your data science questions.  Your answers will be displayed using plotting techniques.  You will house your project and associated files on your Project 1 repository on GitHub.

 <h2>Part 4: Improve Your Plots</h2>
 You will provide and receive feedback to/from your classmates via a Discussion Forum.
