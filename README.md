# Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study

<b>Goal:</b> Using Python, perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.

## Part 1: Data Study Questions
Formulate the data study questions that you will answer in your analysis. Evaluate the survey that was provided for students majoring in the Computer Science department to understand what was asked and what could be analyzed to promote new enrollment in computer science courses.

## Part 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning
The datasets provided are messy.  Explore the datasets, first in `Google Sheets`. Then you use `Python` to bring in your datasets into your coding environment, and explore the datasets further to identify what cleaning actions you will perform on the data. Some data cleaning was done on `Google Sheets`, as the ability to filter data by responses allowed for efficient and rapid cleaning. The filter function also helped when converting responses, as the survey spanned 2020 - 2023 and underwent some changes over the 4 years and thus the responses did not perfectly align.

## Part 3: Data Analysis and Visualization
Using your cleaned dataset, analysis was performed to answer survey data science questions. Data was analyzed using pandas and visualizations were created using matplotlib. Jupyter Notebook of work is housed in Project 1 repository on `GitHub`.

 ## Part 4: Improve Your Plots
 You will provide and receive feedback to/from your classmates via a Discussion Forum.
